📊 Market Entry Analysis: Mobile Market Expansion Strategy (India-China)

🚀 Overview
This project leverages advanced analytics to perform a comprehensive market entry analysis, evaluating opportunities to expand mobile phone operations from an established market in China into the emerging Indian market.

Using demographic and purchasing behavior data, we developed robust statistical models and machine learning techniques to predict consumer purchase behavior, segment customers effectively, and forecast revenue potential. The strategic insights derived help businesses confidently enter new markets with data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Problem Statement
Analyzed market demographics and purchasing behavior to evaluate the viability of entering the Indian mobile phone market by leveraging insights from existing Chinese consumer data. The core objectives included:

Predicting the likelihood of customer purchases using historical data from China.

Segmenting potential customers in India based on demographic characteristics.

Estimating revenue opportunities to guide strategic investment decisions.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Python (for data processing and modeling)

Pandas & NumPy (for data cleaning, exploration, and manipulation)

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression for predictive modeling, KMeans for clustering)
